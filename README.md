# Minor_project_game

This game is purely based on embedded C by using physical programmable 
circuit board (Arduino microcontroller) which can be easily played on OLED by using a joystick and buttons.

For constructing the a simple Acarde game we will be using following items:
1. Arduino
2. Adafruit OLED (128*64bit)
3. NXP LPC1769 
4. Joystick and Buttons
5. Wires for connection
6. Breadboard
7. Breakable Pins

Game plan:
Objective is to create a game that will be controlled by user.
In this game, there will be three things revolving over the oled screen i.e. main character, enemies and friends.
The enemies and friends will come towards the user character, from which user has to savethe friends, if user saved the enemy by mistake the game will over. If user catch friends then it will increase the user scores. User scores will be shown and will continously updates on the top right corner of the Adafruit oled screen.
