# Minor_project_game

This game is purely based on embedded C by using physical programmable 
circuit board (Arduino microcontroller) which can be easily played on OLED by using a joystick and buttons.

For constructing the a simple Acarde game we will be using following items:
1. Arduino
2. Adafruit OLED (128*64bit)
3. NXP LPC1769 
4. Joystick and Buttons
5. Wires for connection
6. Breadboard
7. Breakable Pins

Game plan:
Two characters will be coming from the top of the screen, user character will be controlled by user and user has to save his character by moving its position.
